# Weekly Habit Progress Consistency Fix

## Problem Summary
Weekly habit progress was experiencing random "breaks" and reloads where the UI would suddenly lose progress data and refresh, disrupting the user experience. This happened after initial app start worked correctly.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Aggressive Background Sync
- Background sync ran every 5 minutes regardless of user activity
- When delta sync failed, it would fall back to `forceRefresh()` which completely replaced all data
- This caused the UI to "break" and reload with fresh server data, losing local state

### 2. Race Conditions
- Multiple methods updating weekly progress cache simultaneously:
  - `updateWeeklyProgressCache()` - user actions
  - `updateWeeklyProgressCacheWithFreshData()` - server sync
  - `processWeeklyProgressUpdate()` - consistency checks
  - `invalidateWeeklyProgressCache()` - new week detection

### 3. Cache Invalidation Conflicts
- New week detection would invalidate cache while users were actively viewing weekly progress
- Consistency checks triggered unnecessary refreshes during active sessions

## Solution Implemented

### 1. User Activity Tracking
Added intelligent user activity tracking to `DataCacheManager`:

```swift
// Track when users interact with weekly progress
private var lastUserInteraction: Date = Date()
private let userActivityGracePeriod: TimeInterval = 30 // seconds
private var isUserActivelyInteracting: Bool = false

func trackUserInteraction() {
    lastUserInteraction = Date()
    isUserActivelyInteracting = true
    // Auto-reset after grace period
}
```

### 2. Smart Background Sync
Modified background sync to respect user activity:

```swift
func performBackgroundSync(token: String) async {
    // Skip sync if user is actively interacting
    if shouldSkipSyncDueToUserActivity {
        print("ðŸ‘¤ Skipping background sync - user is actively interacting")
        return
    }
    // ... existing sync logic
}
```

### 3. Protected Cache Updates
Enhanced cache update methods to defer server updates when users are active:

```swift
func safeUpdateWeeklyProgressFromServer(_ freshProgressData: [PreloadManager.WeeklyProgressData]) {
    if shouldSkipSyncDueToUserActivity {
        // Defer update until user is inactive
        Task.detached(priority: .background) {
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(userActivityGracePeriod * 2 * 1_000_000_000))
            // Apply update when safe
        }
        return
    }
    // Apply immediately if user is not active
}
```

### 4. UI-Level Activity Tracking
Added user interaction tracking to all weekly progress UI components:

- **StatsView**: Weekly completion rate and overview cards
- **HabitView**: Weekly habits view and progress displays
- **WeeklyHabitInfoCard**: Individual habit cards
- **SwipeableHabitCard**: Weekly progress badges

```swift
private var weeklyProgress: Int {
    DataCacheManager.shared.trackUserInteraction()
    return habitManager.getWeeklyHabitProgress(for: habit.id)
}
```

### 5. Smart Cache Invalidation
Modified weekly progress invalidation to respect user activity:

```swift
if isNewWeek {
    let shouldInvalidate = !DataCacheManager.shared.shouldSkipSyncDueToUserActivity
    if shouldInvalidate {
        DataCacheManager.shared.invalidateWeeklyProgressCache()
    } else {
        // Defer invalidation until user is inactive
        Task.detached(priority: .background) {
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(60 * 1_000_000_000))
            // Apply invalidation when safe
        }
    }
}
```

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Eliminated Random Breaks**
- Background sync no longer interferes with active user sessions
- UI state remains stable while users are interacting with weekly progress

### 2. **Preserved Data Integrity**
- Server updates are still applied, just deferred until safe moments
- Cache consistency maintained without disrupting UX

### 3. **Smart Timing**
- 30-second grace period prevents sync interference during active use
- Automatic reset ensures sync resumes when user becomes inactive

### 4. **Comprehensive Tracking**
- All weekly progress UI components now notify the cache manager when accessed
- Fine-grained control over when sync operations can safely occur

## Expected Results

1. **Consistent UI**: Weekly progress will no longer randomly "break" and reload
2. **Smooth UX**: Users can interact with weekly habits without sync interference
3. **Data Freshness**: Background updates still occur, just at appropriate times
4. **Better Performance**: Reduced unnecessary cache invalidations and refreshes

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Active Session Testing**: Use weekly progress features while background sync is due
2. **Week Transition Testing**: Verify new week handling doesn't disrupt active users
3. **Background/Foreground**: Test app lifecycle transitions with weekly progress active
4. **Network Conditions**: Test with poor connectivity to verify fallback behavior

This fix maintains all existing functionality while eliminating the disruptive background sync interference that was causing weekly progress inconsistencies.
